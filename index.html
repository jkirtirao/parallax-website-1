        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>In the autumn of your lives, in your 60s, you realize that the road is not endless. You may have watched others slow down and have seen more than one close friend's life turn on a dime.Like seeds shooting signs of life through the soil, spring is a time of rebirth. If it were likened to a human life, spring is the time when we enter the world as innocent as a newborn baby.</p>

        <h2>Section two</h2>
        <p>“Grow old along with me! The best is yet to be, the last of life, for which the first was made.”  The reality is that change is a constant. Our interactions and our experiences cause us to grow and evolve into the people that we become. If we are willing and open to it, we will continue to evolve and grow as individuals and as a couple for the rest of our lives. There isn’t an age or time when learning and growth stops. It never needs to.</p>

        <h2>Section Three</h2>
        <p>The aging process will also affect the resources and the needs/goals of individuals and couples. There are well-documented impacts of aging on health and body functions (Mertz and Stephens 1986). However, there are tremendous variations in the extent of these effects and the point at which they interfere with normal functioning (Capon et al. 1981). Generally, between the ages of 65 and 75 most people do not suffer from medical conditions that seriously restrict their activity. However, after age 75 such restrictions and a general slowing down are more obvious, although most people still can function quite well into their 80's.</p>
